[Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)
- by Dan McKinley

I found this article interesting because it reminds me of the difference between 'bespoke developers' and 'software engineers' that we discussed in previous lectures. As software keeps evolving, increasing in both complexity and the availability of development tools, it is becoming increasingly necessary that — for efficiency and cost control — developers build complex software using boring technologies they are familiar with.

Inevitably, developing software becomes a modular, predictable, and 'boring' business. However, there is always a positive side to this, as Dan wrote in the last part: "Mindful choice of technology gives engineering minds real freedom: the freedom to contemplate bigger questions. Technology for its own sake is snake oil."
